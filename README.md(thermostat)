# thermostat
in this project there are three variables i have used -- desired_temp, normal_temp, current_temp.
desired_temp is the temperature user want from thermostat
normal_temp is the temp where no change is needed. hence no need to turn on the heating or cooling system.
current_temp is the temperature on which thermostat is currently working.
# working
-- If the desired temperature is lower than normal temp ,it means we have to turn on the cooling system and current temp will decrease to desired temp.
-- If the desired temperature is greater than normal temp ,it means we have to turn on the heating system and current temp will increase to desired temp.
